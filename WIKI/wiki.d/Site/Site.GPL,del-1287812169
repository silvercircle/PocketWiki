By contrast, the GNU General Public%0aLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free%0asoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This%0aGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software%0aFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to%0ausing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by%0athe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to%0ayour programs, too.%0a%0aWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not%0aprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you%0ahave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for%0athis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it%0aif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it%0ain new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.%0a%0aTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid%0aanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.%0aThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you%0adistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.%0a%0aFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether%0agratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that%0ayou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the%0asource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their%0arights.%0a%0aWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and%0a(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,%0adistribute and/or modify the software.%0a%0aAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain%0athat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free%0asoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we%0awant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so%0athat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original%0aauthors' reputations.%0a%0aFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software%0apatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free%0aprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the%0aprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any%0apatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.%0a%0aThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and%0amodification follow.%0a%0a===GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE===%0a===TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION===%0a%0a'''0'''. This License applies to any program or other work which contains%0aa notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed%0aunder the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,%0arefers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"%0ameans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:%0athat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,%0aeither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another%0alanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in%0athe term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".%0a%0aActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not%0acovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of%0arunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program%0ais covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the%0aProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).%0aWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.%0a%0a'''1'''. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's%0asource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you%0aconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate%0acopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the%0anotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;%0aand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License%0aalong with the Program.%0a%0aYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and%0ayou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.%0a%0a'''2'''. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion%0aof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and%0adistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1%0aabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:%0a%0a* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.%0a%0a* b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.%0a%0a* c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\\\%0a%0aThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If%0aidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,%0aand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in%0athemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those%0asections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you%0adistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based%0aon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of%0athis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the%0aentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.%0a%0aThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest%0ayour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to%0aexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or%0acollective works based on the Program.%0a%0aIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program%0awith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of%0aa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under%0athe scope of this License.%0a%0a'''3'''. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,%0aunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of%0aSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:%0a%0a* a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,%0a%0a* b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,%0a%0a* c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\\\%0a%0aThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for%0amaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source%0acode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any%0aassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to%0acontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a%0aspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include%0aanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary%0aform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the%0aoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component%0aitself accompanies the executable.%0a%0aIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering%0aaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent%0aaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as%0adistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not%0acompelled to copy the source along with the object code.%0a%0a'''4'''. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program%0aexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt%0aotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is%0avoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.%0aHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under%0athis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such%0aparties remain in full compliance.%0a%0a'''5'''. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not%0asigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or%0adistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are%0aprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by%0amodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the%0aProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and%0aall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying%0athe Program or works based on it.%0a%0a'''6'''. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the%0aProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the%0aoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to%0athese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further%0arestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.%0aYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to%0athis License.%0a%0a'''7'''. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent%0ainfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),%0aconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or%0aotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not%0aexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot%0adistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this%0aLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you%0amay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent%0alicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by%0aall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then%0athe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to%0arefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.%0a%0aIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under%0aany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to%0aapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other%0acircumstances.%0a%0aIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any%0apatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any%0asuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the%0aintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is%0aimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made%0agenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed%0athrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that%0asystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing%0ato distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot%0aimpose that choice.%0a%0aThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to%0abe a consequence of the rest of this License.%0a%0a'''8'''. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in%0acertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the%0aoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License%0amay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding%0athose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among%0acountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates%0athe limitation as if written in the body of this License.%0a%0a'''9'''. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.%0a%0aEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program%0aspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any%0alater version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions%0aeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free%0aSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of%0athis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software%0aFoundation.%0a%0a'''10'''. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free%0aprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author%0ato ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free%0aSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes%0amake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals%0aof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and%0aof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.%0a%0a[@%0a%0a  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY%0aFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN%0aOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES%0aPROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED%0aOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF%0aMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS%0aTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE%0aPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,%0aREPAIR OR CORRECTION.%0a%0a  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING%0aWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR%0aREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,%0aINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING%0aOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED%0aTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY%0aYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER%0aPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE%0aPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.%0a%0a		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS%0a%0a@]%0a%0a%0a
